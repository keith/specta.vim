# specta.vim

Syntax highlighting for the [specta](https://github.com/petejkim/specta)/[expecta](https://github.com/petejkim/expecta) Objective-C test frameworks.


## Installation

### With [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)

Add:

```
Bundle 'Keithbsmiley/specta.vim'
```

To your `.vimrc` and run `BundleInstall` from within vim or `vim +BundleInstall +qall` from the command line

### With [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/specta.vim.git
```

### Setup

You can set the syntax for a file manually with `set syntax=specta`
I recommend you do this in your `.vimrc` detecting your typical test filename, for example in [mine](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc) I use:

```
autocmd BufReadPost,BufWrite *Test.m set filetype=specta
```

This changes the `filetype` to `specta` whenever a file named `*Test.m` is read or written (written sets the syntax correctly for newly created files)

I also recommend you install [cocoa.vim](https://github.com/msanders/cocoa.vim/) which adds some Objective-C highlighting features (automatically used by specta.vim if installed).
